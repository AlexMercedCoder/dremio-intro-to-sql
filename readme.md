# Intro to SQL with Dremio

Welcome to **Intro to SQL with Dremio** — a hands-on workshop designed to teach you the foundations of SQL using Dremio, a modern, high-performance SQL engine built for data lakehouse environments. Whether you're brand new to SQL or just looking to sharpen your skills, this course will guide you through the basics of querying data, filtering results, performing aggregations, and joining tables — all while working with real datasets stored in object storage.

To get started, follow the **[Environment Setup](./lessons.md/0-setup.md)** lesson to spin up a local Docker-based environment with Dremio and sample data. Once you're set up, proceed through the lessons in order and try the hands-on exercises included in each. By the end of this course, you'll have the confidence to write powerful SQL queries and explore your data using Dremio.

Happy querying!
