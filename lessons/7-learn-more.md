# üß≠ Exploring More SQL: Beyond the Basics

You've now completed a solid foundation in SQL using Dremio, covering:

- `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `JOIN`
- Basic filtering and aggregation logic

But SQL is a vast language with **many more features** that can help you build powerful, expressive queries.

Below are some additional SQL keywords and concepts you may encounter. While we haven‚Äôt covered them directly in this course, they are worth exploring further ‚Äî especially in the context of Dremio.
